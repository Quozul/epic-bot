# Epic-bot
Discord bot for my server. You can change the bot's language using the command `?config lang fr`. Default language is English, supported languages are in the `lang` folder.  
If you wish to invite the bot, [here's an invite link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=660424710021971988&scope=bot&permissions=8) (the bot is running in English but can be changed to any languages that are in the `lang` folder).
